    "‚ùóÔ∏èTo be aware that every time rolling a coin yiels an outcome which is the **realization** of *one component* of the possible outcome. Because in the experiment, we are told to roll a coin *three* times, only after we get three realizations each for each time's rolling, we have a **realization** for the possible outcome of the experiment. \n",

    "$$A=\\{3\\}$$\n",
