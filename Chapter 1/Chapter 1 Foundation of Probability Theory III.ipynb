Searching in an array is to check elements in the array one by one, until the target is identified or the end is reached. As the array becomes longer, containing more elements, it takes longer time to finish searching. For a dictionary, it is constructed in a different way, making the time for searching relatively the same for a larger dictionary. \n",
