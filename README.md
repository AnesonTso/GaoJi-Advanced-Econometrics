# 用以厦门大学高等计量经济学课程

## Instruction

The best way to learn a new set of knowledge is to put it into practice. We check what we learn by building from scratch and gain insights by seeing the response. 

This series of notebooks contain notes of the knowledges taught in the courses of GaoJi, a nicked name for *advanced econometrics courses* in WISE, Xiamen University, constructed on *learning* purposes, not intended for *teaching*, that's the reason why I **cannot** guarantee the quality of the notebooks.

## Contents

This series of notebooks contains key knowledges selected from advanced econometric books which are used as textbooks in the courses. In other words, it is based on *advanced econometrics* courses from WISE, Xiamen University. 

It can be used as supplements for students in the same courses, but it's originally means of learning for myself.

If it proves to be helpful for anyone whether enrolled or just interested in the courses of GaoJi, I'd be grateful. If not, the gain really deserves the efforts for me.

## Last but not least

Due to limited understanding of theoretical aspects and lack of practical development experience, my sense towards some knowledge may be biased and code may seem too immature. Any kinds of advice and correction are welcome, and will be responded with a humble heart ❤️ 

#### Hope you like it, from a salted fish struggling in GaoJi.
